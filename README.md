## World Development Indicators analysis

The following report focuses on analyzing the *World Development Indicators* (WDI) data about the prosperity of many countries in the world with a goal to find some interesting correlations and observations. Additionally, an attempt was made to make a regressor that can predict the price of Bitcoin based on this data (as well as data about gold prices, S&P Composite values, and currency values).

The data has been gathered mainly by the World Bank and it contains more than 200 statistics that measure general market development among most countries in the world.
